\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the Students \& Companies (S\&C) project is to create a platform that efficiently matches university students with suitable internship opportunities based on their skills, experiences, and prefer- ences, while also meeting the needs of companies seeking to recruit talent. The platform streamlines the entire internship process, from profile creation and internship listings to matching, interview man- agement, and feedback collection. It aims to improve the overall internship experience, enhance the selection process, and provide universities with tools to monitor and ensure the quality of internships, ultimately benefiting students, companies, and academic institutions alike.
The S\&C platform creates a dynamic ecosystem where students, companies, and universities collaborate seamlessly to improve the internship matching process. The systemâ€™s features not only save time for both students and companies but also enhance the quality and success of internships, ultimately leading to more fulfilling and productive experiences for all parties involved.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=G{\arabic*}]
\item
Allows registered students to create their profile and CV and search for internships and apply to them.
\item
Allows registered companies to create and post advertisement for available internship roles and select suitable candidate.
\item 
Provide an efficient and intelligent matchmaking process between students and companies based on the students' skills and preferences, the companies' internship descriptions.
\item
Support both students and companies during the selection process, including interview scheduling, questionnaire, feedback collection, and facilitating communication.
\item
Allows registered universities to monitor the internship statuses of their students and take action on any issues or complaints.

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Scope}
The scope of this Design Document (DD) is to evaluate the technical, operational, and organizational aspects of the software engineering project in order to assess its alignment with business goals. This document discusses the architecture used in this project, highlights all the main components to be created and how they interact. This document also introduces the implementation and testing principles to be used to ensure robustness of the software.
