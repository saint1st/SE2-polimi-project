\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

To interact with the Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform, all users, including students, companies, and universities, must utilize suitable devices that support internet connectivity and web browsers. The system is designed to function on standard computing devices, such as personal computers, laptops, and tablets.

These requirements ensure smooth operation of the platform, especially during real-time activities such as interviews, feedback submissions, and monitoring processes.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

The Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform includes several key software components: an in-app notification system keeps users informed about important events, like new internship postings or updates to their applications. An EmailService helps with registration and sends timely updates and confirmations. The RecommendationEngine matches students with internships by analyzing their profiles and preferences. A FeedbackSystem allows users to share their thoughts, improving the platform over time. Universities can also monitor and manage internships using built-in support and complaint-handling tools.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

The Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform requires a stable internet connection to function effectively. It enables students to browse internships, companies to post opportunities, and universities to monitor ongoing internships. Reliable communication is essential for real-time notifications, updates, and interactions between all parties involved.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

The system shall ensure good performance in service of all kinds of users, including students, companies, and universities, efficiently. For usability, it shall meet the following minimum performance criteria:

The system should respond to user actions such as navigation or form submission in less than 1 second under normal conditions.
The system should support up to n users' concurrent access without significant degradation of performance, based on the number of students.

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform is conscious of and fully respects all data protection and security policies in light of the General Data Protection Regulation, otherwise known as the GDPR, along with assurances that guarantee data protection within the EU and EEA territories. It uses the modern international standard for date and time formatting.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The following hardware requirements are to be met by the user in order for the platform to work:

 - The devices should facilitate stable internet connectivity, ensuring at least one of the following standards: 3G, 4G, 5G, IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.3. The connections can be wired or wireless but reliable and maintain connectivity with the use of a modem, router, or any related device.
 - The hardware specifications of the devices need to be up-to-date, with a processor at least like Intel i5 or i7 and a display resolution not lower than Full HD. Besides, a minimum of 8 GB RAM is also essential for a smooth performance.
\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
The platform should be easy to handle by students and companies alike. The interface must support users at any level of technical skill so that searching for internships, submitting CVs, and tracking applications would be smooth and fast.


\subsection{Software System Attributes}

This section defines the non-functional requirements and software quality attributes that the Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform must meet to ensure reliability, security, and maintainability.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
 The system should support offline backups to recover from potential data loss and minimize disruption.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The system should be available to provide its functionalities with a minimum of 99.5\% uptime, meaning that the downtime is less than two days annually. Therefore, the platform should ensure redundancy for the critical components and perform scheduled maintenance during periods of low traffic.
\subsubsection{Security}
The platform should securely store user data, including the encryption of sensitive information like passwords and personal details. It shall use secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS, for securing data in transit from client to server. Then again, protection against internal and external threats should be good enough, with firewalls and intrusion detection systems amongst others. Besides, sensitive operations shall be restricted based on user role and permission.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The platform's codebase should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update. Clear comments and proper version control practices must be applied throughout the development lifecycle.
\subsubsection{Portability}
Being a web-based application, the platform should support the use of popular browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It is also expected to be accessible via different devices: smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
