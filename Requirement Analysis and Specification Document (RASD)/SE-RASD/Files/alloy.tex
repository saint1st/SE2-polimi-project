\subsection{Objectives of the analysis}
The analysis checks that students are matched with internships based on their skills and the requirements of the internship, making sure each student is only assigned to one internship. It also ensures that both students and companies are available at the same time for interviews and that no student is assigned to more than one internship. The internships follow a set process from creation to completion, and students' complaints and company details are kept confidential.
